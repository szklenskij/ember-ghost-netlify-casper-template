BanQuest was an RPG themed around living food acting as both the playable characters and the monsters of a tabletop game. With all different foods being different races and monsters, there was plenty of opportunity to be creative with such a project.

The Asparagus Wizard was one such creation. The playable races would be Asparagus (Elves), Potato (Dwarfs), and Cupcakes (Humans?) among other races.  
As for the baddies, Broccoli would be like the goblins of this realm, Drumsticks as ravaging hounds, or even Squash as ogres as seen below.
