Partway through my 2nd semester of Freshman year I managed to fulfill one of the dreams that I had fantasized about when looking forward to college in general: starting my own D&D campaign. It started out as a more rigid one-off that I figured I would let evolve into a campaign if it went well -- it did. Two semesters later, we are in the third "season" of our campaign. For this semester especially, we have missed sessions (we play Wednesdays from around 9 pm until midnight or so) due to essays, the need to study for exams, or a number of other life/college events. At this point, I have allowed the session to become much more of a social gathering than I used to let it. I normally didn't have each session well planned out, and honestly I rarely had encounters elaborately planned out for the sessions. I had a general direction and the direction of the campaign has been directed by a few things that I planted a semester or two ago, which I feel is a good trait for a D&D campaign to have, but you can judge for yourself: view the tales that bards will sing of for a millennia to come, the grand adventures of '[Damaged Goods](/page/meet/).'
