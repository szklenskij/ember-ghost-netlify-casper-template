Thoridin Frostbeard, a powerful, drunken, gay hill dwarf is the rock of the party... Or, should I say anchor, as he spent many years of his life on the sea, gaining knowledge in both medicine and seafaring before meeting his lover, Derik, an orc warrior and companion of the party. Thoridin is the party's cleric, but he is generally dealing more damage than healing it.

Rolk, the kobold bard, raised in civilization with an air of sophistication about him, he is justifiably the improviser and gap-filler for the group. Often seen in diplomats cloths running baddies through with his rapier and attended by his unseen butler, Bertrum, the kobold makes up for his small stature with a fearsome quest for power.

Rhogar, a dragonborn sorcerer hailing from the East does his best to keep the party's morals in check. He adventures seeking to become strong enough to avenge his slain tribe and take revenge directly to the man that caused all of the pain that he carries with him.

Shin is a human monk who follows a philosophy that his hands shall do no harm. Thankfully, being a monk, his legs and feet are just as apt to deal damaging blows to his adversaries. Generally a voice of reason along with Rhogar, Shin also does a fair amount of talking for the party, dealing with a multitude of situation, although he may not be the most charismatic of the bunch.
