Among all of the my ideas to be used for tabletop games, there have been ones about vegetables, multiple groups playing in the same room, "reaction dice" for a horror-based game night, and plans for numerous modern and future-set games. There was even an entirely food-based version of a tabletop that a friend and I were working on for a while, with all different foods being different races and monsters.
