Among all of the my ideas to be used for tabletop games, there have been ones about vegetables, multiple groups playing in the same room, "reaction dice" for a horror-based game night, and plans for numerous modern and future-set games. There was even an entirely food-based version of a tabletop that a friend and I were working on for a while, with all different foods being different races and monsters. You can find more info on that [here](/banquest). I feel that coming up with themes and various projects has been fun and comes relatively easily to me. Planning for my individual session of regular Dungeons & Dragons is usually something I just do on the fly however. I do feel guilty of it, but as I have said before, my homebrew campaign has become more of a social gathering than anything, so structure is not of the utmost importance. But, for my other games, such as [D&D Guilds](/guilds), a lot more planning could go into what I have prepare each week. This is partially do to the small player base that has been active, as I am lacking in DMs to help me run more groups, which is supposed to be the whole point. It is difficult though, running Cross Country and Track to always have weekends available and to work around the schedules of everyone else.
