Hey! Welcome to my website, it's great to have you :)

This is in the very first stages of infancy and I am still messing around with all this template has to offer.


### There are a few things that you should know up-front:


1. I'm still trying to figure out how to get emojis to work, because I really want them, even though I don't know where I'll be using them...

1. I Have plans for numerous easter eggs to be hidden throughout the side, as well as memes, gifs, and other fun stuff.

1. I also plan to try and implement some sort of achievement tracker or badges for doing stuff cuz that would be kool.

### Quick Start

```sh
# if you don't have ember-cli installed already
npm install -g ember-cli

ember new super-blog
cd super-blog

ember install ember-ghost ember-ghost-casper-template
```

It will ask you if you want to update the `index.html` file and you should say yes üëç

If you want to see the blog system running on your local machine just run `npm start` and you will
be able to navigate to  [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) to see the blog in action.

The main thing you'll want to read about next is probably: [editing files with Ember Ghost](/the-editor/).

Once you're done reading, you can simply delete the default **Ghost** user from your team to remove all of these introductory posts!
