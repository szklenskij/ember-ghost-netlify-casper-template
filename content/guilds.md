I have thought of numorous projects for tabletops, most of which have been spin-offs to D&D or some other alteration to a tabletop RPG, many of which I explore on this site. One that I managed to headway the furthest was D&D Guilds, a multi=group, episodic way to play D&D. D&D Guilds is a collective, group based adaptation to 5th edition Dungeons & Dragons. Multiple Dungeon Masters each head their own guild within a city, players pledge to these guilds, working to earn glory for both their characters and their respective guilds. By building this system, it allows many players to take part and enjoy the opportunity to play D&D without having to organize their own group and figure out everything for themselves. That being said, if a group that knows that they want to play together, but may not necessarily possess the resources to do so, they are welcome to integrate their group into D&D Guilds. Our goal is to create an accessible and fun environment to experience D&D 5e in a new way never before seen (at least we think).
\Initially, all the players will be starting off at lower levels completing appropriately scaled quests and earning rewards. As both players the game as a whole advances further, more niche quests will be available as DMs gain a feel for what players want and we discuss the proceedings of the world. Especially as the game moves forward as a whole, players will be able to move beyond just weekly quests, possibly seeking to work the politics of the city or further their guild in another way. Discussing ideas with DMs will be the best way for us to figure out what we can do with the world that we create and we may organize meetings in the future for just that.
