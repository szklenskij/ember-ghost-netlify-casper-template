A terminal-based game/project from Freshman year. I have just found it again in the depths of my computer's directories, but unfortunately it is currently broken for some reason. I would very much like to get it working again and to be able to share it.

<div id="terminal"></div>
      <script>
        var term = new Terminal();
        term.open(document.getElementById('terminal'));
        term.write('Hello from \x1B[1;3;31mxterm.js\x1B[0m $ ')
      </script>
