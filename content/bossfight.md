A terminal-based game/project from Freshman year. I have just found it again in the depths of my computer's directories, but unfortunately it is currently broken for some reason. I would very much like to get it working again and to be able to share it.

<div id="terminal"></div>
      <script>
        Unfortunately, due to time constraints I was unable to implement my project onto my site, but you can download the source files below. The original project was written in java and is simply run with the 'java' command.

You can download the .zip file
